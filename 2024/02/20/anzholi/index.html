<p>Genetic engineering is the deliberate manipulation of an organism's DNA using advanced techniques to modify, add, or remove specific genes, resulting in desired genetic traits or functions.
</p>
<p>At its core, genetic engineering is a set of sophisticated techniques that allow the transfer of genes between organisms or even the synthesis of new genetic material. This is achieved through recombinant DNA technology, where DNA molecules from different sources are combined in vitro into one molecule to create a new set of genes. This DNA is then transferred into an organism, giving it modified or new genes.</p>

<p>In Vitro Fertilization and Artificial Insemination are two of the methods by which the sex of the baby can be selected. In vitro is done by stimulating the ovaries to produce more egg cells (normally the ovaries only produce one egg cell during a menstrual cycle). After stimulating the production of egg cells, they are extracted from the ovaries and fertilization takes place in laboratory conditions (i.e. outside the woman's body). After three to five days, these fertilized egg cells (or embryos) are transferred to the woman's uterus</p>
<p>Before these embryos are transferred to the uterus, it is possible to carry out their genetic analysis - this procedure is called PGD (preimplantation genetic diagnosis). When PGD is performed, the gender of these embryos can also be determined. PGD began to be used 25 years ago in order to identify embryos that may have genetic disorders, but this technique is sometimes used for non-medical reasons, such as the selection of the baby's sex. This method in terms of effectiveness in determining the sex of the baby is almost 100% effective.</p>

<p>So if that woman gets pregnant, she will definitely have the baby of the desired gender. The problem is that this procedure is very expensive and that several interventions must be done during an in vitro fertilization cycle. Another problem is that it often happens that a woman becomes pregnant, but with more than one child (with twins and less often with triplets).</p>

<p>Radiotherapy and laser therapy are two effective methods of fighting cancer by using different technologies to destroy carginogenic cells. These treatments are often part of a combined plan to treat a cancer patient. It is oftentimes the main therapy for some types of cancer, like brain cancer, neck cancer, gallbladder cancer, lung cancer, or Hodgins lymphoma. In other types of cancer, it is only an extensive part of the treatment. Laser therapy, on the other hand, is a new field of scientific research that uses high-energy, focused lightwaves to destroy carcinogenic cells. This method is especially effective for specific tumors and has a lot of potential for reducing the side effects of traditional methods of treatment.</p>

</figure>

<p>In the process of radiotherapy, a patient is exposed to a certain amount of radiation during a specific period of time. This dosage and time are determined carefully by the medical team in order to ensure the destruction of carcinogenic cells and minimize the possible damage to healthy cells. All cells grow and undergo division to create new cells. Cancer cells grow and divide much faster than the vast majority of regular cells around them. Radiation therapy uses special equipment to offer high amounts of radiation. This damages cancer cells and causes their death. This works by cutting or breaking down a fragment of the DNA molecule inside a cancer cell, which allows cells to grow, split, and spread.</p>
<p>Regular cells in the body may also be affected by the radiation, but the majority will recover completely from the side effects of the therapy and return to their normal state. Compared to chemotherapy, which exposes the entire body to cancer treated through medication, radiation therapy is usually a localized form of treatment that only affects one part of the body. A common challenge that is faced in cancer treatment is the management of side effects. Some common issues are fatigue, skin irritation, nausea, etc., or for laser therapy, skin redness and burning sensations. These forms of treatment have been improving at rapid rates and are expected to help significantly in the fight against cancer.</p>

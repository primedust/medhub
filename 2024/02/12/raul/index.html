    <p>How often have you heard the phrase “I’m only human” after someone makes a mistake? Humans have limitations, but in surgery, there’s no room for error. Today, surgeons often rely on robots to assist with surgerie.Robotic surgery isn’t performed without humans. Instead, the robots enhance a human’s precision, control, and flexibility during precise procedures. Surgical robots have several arms. One robotic arm has a camera, through which the surgeon can see what they’re working on, and other arms are various surgical instruments. The surgeon controls the robot using a computer that is located near the operating table.</p>

<p>The greater precision from surgical robots allows for a more minimally invasive procedure, which comes with a wide array of benefits, including:
•Shorter hospital stays
•Faster recovery times
•Fewer complications
•Reduced risk of infection
•Smaller incisions
•Smaller scars
•Less pain
•Reduced blood loss</p>

<p>
Artificial intelligence is one of the most popular technological advances in the world right now.
It allows search engines to:
•Predict what you want to know
•Maximizes logistics for transportation company
•Fly commercial planes through the use of algorithms that automate many of the decisions typically made by human pilots.</p>
<p>There has been great success using AI to determine stem cell placement in the eye, heart, and brain to maximize regeneration and find the optimal locations for anti-cancer therapies. While AI isn’t able to operate independently or make medical decisions, it’s giving surgeons vital information that they need to perform procedures and maximize surgical outcomes.</p>

    <p>The syndrome begins over 40 years of age. Testosterone is the male sex hormone produced in the testicles, is the most important one produced by the male body. With age the production of hormones decreases. This is responsible for puberty in male skin. The importance of the male hormone appears in the treatment of muscles, in the metabolism of fat and proteins.</p>

<p>When testosterone falls below the norm, we have hypogonadism and the man shows these signs: bad mood, he may have a depressive state, unnecessary irritation, sleep adjustments, rapid fatigue physical, which comes as a cause by the decreased testosterone levels and decreased muscle mass. At this age, the fat tissue of the genoid type (of the female type) is recreated, which you will show in the waist, shoulders, and buttocks. After the patient is presented with this complaint he is asked to take a blood test, for the determination of testosterone. Values between 12 and 15 mol/l are considered normal. While values below 12 mol/l should be treated if the typical symptoms of testosterone symptoms are present. Alcohol and smoking accelerates the appearance of andropause.</p>

<figcaption>Stages of menopause.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The average age of menopause is 51 years old. If reproductive ability is lost before the age of 40, then we are dealing with premature ovary failure. The late reproductive phase is characterized by the beginning of the expenditure of follicular reserves and then, as a result, with hormonal insufficiency, which gives us visible signs such as changes in the character of monthly bleeding, among other things, menstrual cycles begin to shorten. The age of the beginning of the first menstrual bleeding has no influence on the age of menopause, nor does taking contraceptives have an influence on this. 2-8 years before menopause, menstrual cycles begin to lengthen, because now a menstrual cycle begins to be without ovulation. More than 1000 primordial follicles in the ovaries begin to lose their function and no longer manage to evolve. Hormonal loss will naturally cause changes in the female body as a whole. The main signs such as increased sensitivity, insomnia, depression, migraine, headache, etc. are secondary signs. During this period, it is important for women to have increased physical activity, visiting the gym or even walking for at least an hour during the day. This activity, along with vitamin D and calcium supplements, will counteract the negative effect of hormones on bone density.</p>
<p>Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT): This method is only recommended for patients entering menopause at a young age and for patients with moderate or severe symptoms. In 
    addition, it prevents heart diseases, osteoporosis, etc. Hormonal therapy is now recommended to prevent disease.</p>
